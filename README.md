# Data-Science-Python-Practice
This repository involves the jupyter notebook I created while working on different libraries like numPy, pandas, Plotly 
Matplotlib, Seaborn.

There are multiple notebooks in the form of IPYNB files. 
Each file has a name which containes relevant to the file name. Ex- Pandas Notebook contains code helpful for understanding pandas features

Please help yourself to use the code as per your needs and interests. I will update it as soon as I learn new topics.

For Machine Learning, the repository has a machine learning folder containing linear and logisitic regression codes. Don't miss that :)
